# MeDIAR
A web-based tool that allows the exploration of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) generated using association rule mining. The three views display the overview of all generated signals, a glyph representation for understanding the scores of respective rules/signals for each drug-drug interaction (many rules for similar DDI) and the reports associated with a DDI.
