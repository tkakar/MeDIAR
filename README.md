# MeDIAR
A web-based tool that allows the exploration of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) generated using association rule mining. The three views include an overview of all the machine-generated signals, a glyph representation for understanding the scores of respective signals for each drug-drug interaction, where a single DDI be associated with multiple sets of reactions (rules), and the reports associated with a selected DDI.

Please read the following publications for further details on the machine learning component as well as the design of the analytics and glyphs.

* [MEDIAR](/papers/mediar.pdf) - Design of the interactive analytics

The [Tool](https://tkakar.github.io/MeDIAR/) can be accessed to interactively explore the DDIs and their score distributions along with the underlying reports used to generate the signals.
